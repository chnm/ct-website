Meha Priyadarshini is Lecturer in History at the University of Edinburgh. Her research covers the areas of global history, material culture studies, colonial Latin American history and the emerging new field of global Asian studies.

Her work specializes on the connections between colonial Latin America and Asia, using methodologies and approaches of material culture studies to investigate the connection between the two regions. Her first book Chinese Porcelain in Colonial Mexico: The Material Worlds of an Early Modern Trade (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) is a study of the transpacific trade connection through the production, trade, and consumption of porcelain. Her latest book-length publication is the edited volume Transpacific Engagements: Trade, Translation and Visual Culture of Entangled Empires (Getty Research Institute, 2022). Meha completed a PhD at Columbia University and has held numerous fellowships, including one at the Getty Research Institute, as well as at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz – Max-Planck-Institut.
